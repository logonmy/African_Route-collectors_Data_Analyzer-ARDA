# African_Route-collectors_Data_Analyzer-ARDA
This repository contains the codes used to build the African Route-Collectors Data Analyzer (ARDA): https://arda.af-ix.net. The ARDA is the fruit of a 2,5 years collaboration with UC3M-ISOC from October 2015, aiming at building an open-source platform able to support the growth of IXPs within a region, in this case, applied to the Internet frontier: AfriNIC Region. The released codes have been written by the authors of their commits : Roderick Fanou (Architecture design, data collection and Computation modules) and Victor Sanchez-Ag√ºero (Architecture design, Data Collection and Visualization modules).

A.R.D.A. is an open-source web application, which offers unique views of the current status of interconnection and traffic exchange in the African region and its evolution from 2005. A.R.D.A makes use of data collected from all PCH and RouteViews collectors deployed at existing African IXPs. The computed and displayed statistics are classified into 3 views: 

1. The IXP View where we provide several statistics per IXP 
2. The National View where we display statistics per set of IXPs in the same country
3. The Regional View where we plot statistics computed based on the data from all IXPs in the region

The application has been launched on April 21, 2017.
