# African_Route-collectors_Data_Analyzer-ARDA
This repository contains the codes used to build the African Route-Collectors Data Analyzer (ARDA): https://arda.af-ix.net. The ARDA is the fruit of a 2,5 years collaboration with UC3M-ISOC aiming at building an open-source platform able to support the growth of IXPs within a region, in this case, applied to the Internet frontier: AfriNIC Region.
